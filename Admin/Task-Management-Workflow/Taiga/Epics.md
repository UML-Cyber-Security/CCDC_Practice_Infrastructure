# Epics
An *Epic* is the largest organizational unit in Taiga that we use to represent something we want to do. This is often an [Objective](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/okr#:~:text=Objectives%3A%20are%20memorable%2C%20qualitative%20descriptions%20of%20what%20you%20want%20to%20achieve.%20Objectives%20should%20be%20short%2C%20inspirational%2C%20and%20engaging.%20An%20objective%20should%20motivate%20and%20challenge%20the%20team.), aka a large but clear end goal.  For example, Epics could be "Create a Website Landing Page", "Create Practice Infrastructure", or "Web Security Event". They are something that is large, and can be finished (so not something like "Maintain Website"). And also not tasks which are trivial to complete like "Fix Spelling Mistake."

The *Epic* is a part of a [Project](./Project.md), a larger, long-lasting thing like "Maintain Website." The *Epic* contains [Stories](./Stories.md) and [Tasks](./Tasks.md) which represent smaller, key results like "Implement a Website Landing Page" and their subtasks like "Fix Spelling Mistakes".
