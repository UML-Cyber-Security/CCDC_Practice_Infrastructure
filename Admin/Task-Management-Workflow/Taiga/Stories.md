# Stories 
A Story is the second largest organization unit for something that needs to be done in a Taiga [Project](./Project.md). A user story is *related* or *attached* to a [Epic](./Epics.md), they are the Smaller [Key Results](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/okr#:~:text=Key%20results%3A%20are%20a%20set,two%20to%20five%20key%20results) used to organize the subtasks and measure how complete an *Epic* is. 

A story is not something small like "Fix Spelling Mistake" or "Modify HTML -- Add name to About Page", those tend to be something more suited to a [Task](./Tasks.md). A *Story* is generally something that is not as trivial, like "Update Application Documentation" or "Update Website Landing Page." Stories are part of an *Epic*, they are not too complicated, but can be used to measure our progress in completing the *Epic*.
