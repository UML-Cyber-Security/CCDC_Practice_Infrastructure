# Project
A project is exactly what it sounds like. You create a *taiga project* for a project that you're working on. Projects should be atomic, do not mix tasks or objectives between projects. Once completed, the *taiga project* can be removed to reduce clutter. 

A project contains **every** object Taiga provides, this includes Epics, Stories, Issued, and a Wiki to name a few! These all have their own documents that can be referenced, in addition to those provided by Taiga.

## Creation and Setup Steps
1. Access the Taiga Home Page, It may look something like the image below

4. Fill out the information, you will probably want it to be private, as we likely want to control who can access the project
