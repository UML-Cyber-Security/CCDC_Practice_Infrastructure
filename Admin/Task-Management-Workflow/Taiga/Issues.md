# Issues
In Jira, all of the units we interact with are a type of *issue*. **Taiga** distinguishes the normal [Objectives](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/okr#:~:text=Objectives%3A%20are%20memorable%2C%20qualitative%20descriptions%20of%20what%20you%20want%20to%20achieve.%20Objectives%20should%20be%20short%2C%20inspirational%2C%20and%20engaging.%20An%20objective%20should%20motivate%20and%20challenge%20the%20team.), [Key results](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/okr#:~:text=Key%20results%3A%20are%20a%20set,two%20to%20five%20key%20results) and [Tasks](./Tasks.md) from *issues* that you may be familiar with from [Git/GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues). Issues are where we can track supplemental problems that need to be solved, such as questions, bugs, and enhancements. Additional configurations can be added by an Admin in the settings.
