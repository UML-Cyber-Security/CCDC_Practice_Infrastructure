# Wiki
The *Taiga Wiki* is a centralized location for the Documentation and notes associated with a project. We use this as a replacement for the shared pages provided by applications such as [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence).  We hope that the wiki is used to centralize working notes and documentation for the project.
