Experience was good overall, as I was working on setting up Wazuh, something that I have dChallenges: one before. 

Ubuntu machine was not setup with enough hard drive space to actually install Wazuh and docker, so a reinstallation was needed.

It was found out that it is impossible to add more hard drive space, without downloading gparted to repartition the hard drive. 

Upon reinstallation of a new ubuntu, it was discovered that setting up Ubuntu from the Server iso file was much more difficult than the default method.
