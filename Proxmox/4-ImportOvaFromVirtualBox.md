# Import OVA file from VirtualBox
*Author:* Chris Morales

*Summary:* This guide covers how to manually import an `.ova` file exported from VirtualBox into Proxmox. There is no native support for this feature and so manual effort is required. 

## Download the OVA file onto Proxmox
You can do this directly from the Proxmox Server (**host** machine) or on a separate computer and transfer over the files using some file transfer program like SCP **onto the Promox Server**.

## Unzip the OVA file
An .ova file contains three files (the * means any file name):
1. *.vmdk
2. *.mf
3. *.ovf

The main file that we need is the `.vmdk` file. In this guide, you'll see it as `Kali-CRV3-disk001.vmdk`. This is the virtual hard disk of the virtual machine, the other files contain configuration information for VirtualBox.


## Create a target machine location for the qcow2 file on Proxmox
For this guide, a converted `.vmdk` was placed into into a NFS server. When you look at the `VM Disks` of the machines under the NFS `ccdc2024Storage` storage location, it's not intuitive as to where these are being held within the NFS mount.

And so, we can run the `tree` command on the NFS share to find these devices.

Notice how the `.qcow2` files are sorted under the corresponding machine ID that they are attached to. We will keep that format . In this case, it will be VM 130.

```
mkdir /mnt/pve/ccdc2024Storage/images/130
```

## Convert the VMDK to Proxmox VM's format (vmdk -> qcow2)
This method is slightly more reliable than another method that tries to import the vmdk directly and use the `--convert qcow2` flag.

For this method, you will be using the `qemu-img` command. The format is:

```
qemu-img convert -f vmdk -O qcow2 <ova-file>.vmdk <converted-qcow2-filename>
```

*Note: It may take a while for it to complete. Be patient.*

In this case, I'm simply just renaming the file to have the appropriate extension.

You can see if it worked by refreshing the proxmox webpage where you found the `Disk Images` before.

## Create the VM on using CLI
Finally, you'll want to create the Virtual Machine and assign it the newly converted qcow2 file.


```
qm create 130 --name "test-Kali" --memory 2048 --net virtio,bridge=vmbr0 --sockets 1 --cores 1 --virtio0 ccdc2024Storage:130/Kali-CRV3-disk001.qcow2
```


This command creates a VM with the `ID 130` that has the name `test-Kali` which will have `2048 MB of RAM`, uses the `vmbr0` network adapter, is allocated `1 socket and 1 core` for CPU which, and will have the hard disk assigned from our `ccdc2024Storage` storage location under the ID 130 folder and looking for the `Kali-CRV3-disk001.qcow2` hard disk image.


## Start the machine from Proxmox GUI

Start the machine from the Proxmox GUI and then you should be all set.
