# Proxy Servers
## What does a proxy server do?
Proxy servers retreive data for the user, it may be seen as acting as a middleman between the user and the private network ([*What is a Proxy Server?*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cPIukqXe5w), PowerCert Animated Videos).

*Example*:
    If the user wanted to view a website, the user sends a request to the proxy to view the website, in this scenario, the proxy acts as a middleman between the data and the userm and the proxy retrieves a view of the website for the user, and sends it to the user's computer.
