November 13th writeup

What i did 
worked on inject
tried to fix issue with machine
did some red team studying

What happened at practice
The main attack was disabling windows defender
I did this through task schedular disabling it every 5 minutes
I also added some user

Windows defender stayed down the whole time but that did not do much
The users got disabled pretty quickly 
we had some admin ssh access for about half of it but we 
did't have any scripts ready to take advantage of them

What I want to work on
Learn about wsl
and openssh
get their private key and see what I can do with it
also reverse shells
