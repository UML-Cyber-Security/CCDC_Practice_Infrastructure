### Homework

For my homework this week I was tasked with enabling RDP, SSH, and WinRM on all of the windows machines. I was able to successfully get RPD and SSH to work however I was struggling with WinRM. I was struggling with WinRM becasuse I needed it to be under https when it was under http, however to get WinRM to work under https I needed to have a SSL Certificate which I did not know how to create onto their machine.

### Work during the meeting
During the meeting I was able to gain access to their machines using ssh and rdp but after out free access period ended they were able to kick us out pretty quickly. I was in a SSH terminal for about 20 more minutes after the service was shut off but I could not get much work done in that time period. I was focusing on re-enabling the accounts that we had made before the meeting but I found no luck doing that for some reason. He then kicked me out of the SSH session so I had no more access to the machines. After this we knew it was going to be very difficult to regain access so we focused on planning for our next attacks.
