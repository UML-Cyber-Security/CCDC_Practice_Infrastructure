November 6th Writeup

Things I did since last practice
Worked alot on setting up CA as that was on the inject
-Got CA up on a windows machine
-Shared a certificate to another windows machine
looked into a few ways windows can be hacked and what things to look for

What happened at practice
Did not go the best
Mostly issues on our end more than anything they did
When trying to get up windows defender it messed up rdp
Also when trying to disable local account we had some issues
We did find some extra accounts in AD that we deleted/disabled
We also set up two windows machines but didnt do anything with them

After Practice / To-do
Bernal sent me his writeup for the attack so I
looked into those and fixed some things like 
him messing up hosts for antivirsus
I still need to go through all of them (mostly winrm)

I need to get CA on linux machines
research some fun attacks for monday
