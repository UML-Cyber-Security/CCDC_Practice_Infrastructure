CJ Writeups

1. Swapped to a new resource document: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-qp7sFlcyrijbtA8uxY2IabFBohMduujYsI4v667aLw/edit#gid=0
2. Updated it to properly show resource numbers, and logged the entire infastructure. 
3. Helped provide some descriptions to teams which didn't add anything until the last five minutes.
3. Started to create a vault testing enviroment, but did not finish cloning since all of the ccdc was taking up precious proxmox resources. Will finish in the coming week/weeks (because we are red team now)
