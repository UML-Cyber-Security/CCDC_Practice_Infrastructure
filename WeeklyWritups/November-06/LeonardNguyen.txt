What I did:
  I set up an apache webserver for the linux 1 and 2 machines.

Monday:
  We were given phase 3, although we needed to distribute tasks accordingly. To my understanding of the meeting, we'll all be creating the blackteam user on our respective machines.
  The rest of the meeting was spent searching for the keyloggers.

Going forward:
  Find the keylogger and work on red team tasks.
