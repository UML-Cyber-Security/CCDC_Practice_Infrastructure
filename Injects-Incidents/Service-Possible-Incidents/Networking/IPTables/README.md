# IPTables
For the Linux machines this is the Firewall of choice. IPTables has been superseded by NFTables, but NFTables can still use the command syntax of IPTables (Which is what we do!) 

This is Critical as each system's firewall can be used to prevent services from communicating with one another, 

## Possible Misconfigurations 
* Primarily this would be the addition of blocking rules, or the removal of accepting rules. 
  * Both Input and Output comminations
* The firewall could be disabled

## Impact
This would be quite impactful since this would simply prevent communications between services; this prevents successful score checks or the score checks themselves. Since you need *sudo* pillages to modify the IPtables rules this means the attacker has root access and likely has compromised passwords. 

## Indicators of Compromise
We would only be able to tell by the use of iptables or nftables commands using something like auditd. We may also be able to tell by the failure of score checks, or logs generated by the services (Failed to connect... etc)
