# Inject Response Template

Here is the inject response template that we'll be using. It's made in such a way that it should be easy to just put in the relevant information. 

## Reminders

1) These must be **PROFESSIONAL**. Be concise and careful when writing these. Do not use any slang, acronyms (unless previously defined).
2) Individuals working on the inject themselves, make sure you write your responses so that they are easy to digest and follow.
3) Work with technical writers to make sure that edge cases and potential questions are being answered.
4) Send **editable link/file** to Chris (or alternate team leader) **by** the 5 minute mark. The more time the better. He'll submit the corresponding pdf.
5) We need to submit **something** for these injects. 1 point > 0 points.
6) Proofread each other's work. Don't want to waste time on the small things.

## Steps to start working
There are a few ways that you can collaborate with your team members on this.

### One computer
1) Just download and have one person writing all the information for example.

### Multiple people writing
1) ONE person download the inject template 
2) Upload the docx file onto GD.
3) Share an editing link to the other members on this file.
4) Work on it.
