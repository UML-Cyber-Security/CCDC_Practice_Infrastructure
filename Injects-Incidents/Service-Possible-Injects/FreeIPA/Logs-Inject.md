# FreeIPA
FreeIPA is an identity management system that allows users to authenticate as a user before they try to gain access to materials that they are cleared to have access to. This is a critical portion of the infrastructure because without it there can be no login process.

**Time**: 30-45min (Contains the estimated time of competition)

## Expectations 
What should be implemented and completed by the time this inject is completed 
1. Logs with desired information must be located and kept track of
2. Configuration must be altered for a new log file.
3. Logs associated with step 1 must be set to also go the the file in step 2.

## Dependencies
Access to the log files as well as the configuration files for creation and parsing is needed.

## Inject
We don't like the work needed to see whats going on in the identity server. Give us a streamlined way to monitor its usage.
