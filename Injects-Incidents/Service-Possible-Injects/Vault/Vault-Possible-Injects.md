Dear TEAM,

Management doesnâ€™t trust that all our secrets and data is secure. They concerned about the potential risks associated with unencrypted data transmission, due to the news headline of multiple reported network security breaches, in multiple US based companies. Therefore, to guarantee the protection of sensitive information within Vault, we are asking for confirmation that TLS encryption is effectively implemented and utilized.

Best  regards, 
Baby fu.
