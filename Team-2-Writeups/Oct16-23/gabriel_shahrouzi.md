# 10.16.2023 Writeup

## Goal
Create three Linux Machines for DMZ

## Observations
I noticed that there was a lot of downtime while things were getting installed. This time could have been either used to communicate with teammates about
future details that need to be implemented or learning about technologies that will need to be implemented later. Also, I realized the team that the windows
machines used a template to make the creation process faster and took note of the hardware specs and added that to the documentation. After getting the virtual
machine set up on Proxmox, I did not get a chance to implement dns masking. 

## Improvements/Reflection
I could take documentation during downtime or while talking to teammates to store concrete information of what we have so far and what the plan will be
moving forwards. Also, I should try to learn topics that I think will be useful for future CCDC meetings so that I do not have to look up information
constantly before moving onto to the next step. There are many resources online which some universities have made such that anyone is able to access them.

## Machine Hardware
 - 10GB storage 
 - 1 core
 - 1GB ram
