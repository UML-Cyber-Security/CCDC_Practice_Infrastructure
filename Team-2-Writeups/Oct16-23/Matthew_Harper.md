# October 16th 2023 Writeup <!-- omit from toc -->
This is a writeup for the aforementioned date above it is organized into the following 
- [Progress](#progress)
- [Observations](#observations)
- [Improvements/Reflection](#improvementsreflection)

## Progress 
We made some progress on the creation of infrastructure. A plan has been created for said infrastructure which is nice, This will be linked to and uploaded later when there is more time. The Rocky Linux machines have been created, they were in the process of getting applications loaded onto them. Security has not been implemented and I will look into making a list of what needs to be done so that can be worked on in people's free time.  
## Observations
There was on my end a bit of a struggle to get things going. Not sure if everyone knows everyone elses name yet; it would be a bit unreasonable to think everyone would do it, but I think the people who were working together had done so before, therefore they at least knew each others names. 

For the most part everyone would (with minor prompting) start looking into something they could do to secure, or implement an application on their machines. There was some jumping ahead so we may want to create an action plan for what needs to be done.

The ubuntu installations took a really long time, probably want to look into ways to prevent that... 

Communications were a bit siloed, and objections need to be raised right when they are relevant. Not half way into the scenario!

Documentation needs to be centralized in some way.
## Improvements/Reflection
1. Better planning, it was a bit of "Matt go do x" which is probably intentional but articulating and planning on the fly needs to be something we do better 
2. Time Management
   * Everyone seemed to try and do something when their machines were just loading. There is not much you can do but there were attempts to look into what can be done to secure the machines, and how to implement their application services. 
3. Documentation 
   * People were noting things down (when they could) if someone was implementing something, the other person would note down what was done. Not sure if this was something that was appreciated but I liked it. 
   * We *need* to centralize this into one area, and have some kind of organization.
4. Experience 
   * Probably the biggest issue is a lack of experience with the goals of the competition (what is worth out time vs what is not) and what should be done. This is an issue for me too since the planning mostly fell on my head. 
5. Access to the Google Doc/PDF that was being displayed made life a little complicated when it came to how is this planned...

I did like attempting to help people, but when all we are doing is waiting for machines to load, there is not much that can be done. Solving simple problems is also fun, but being left to budget things is not :). 

The main thing that needs to be noted is that we need to create a document explaining **why** it is not possible for us to create the infrastructure as desired in a secure and usable manner.
