## OpenProject
We are using OpenProject to preform some level of Task Management and tracking, please refer to the relevant documentation in the [Task-Management-Workflow/OpenProject](./Task-Managment-Workflow/OpenProject/OpenProject.md) directory. This is likely going to evolve and change as time progresses!

The old documentation in the [Task-Management-Workflow/Taiga](./Task-Managment-Workflow/Taiga/) directory may still be relevant but not in a direct manner.

## Accessing Infrastructure
1. Connect to the OpenVPN server using your certificate. This requires the [OpenVPN Client](https://openvpn.net/client/)
   * UML Students will need to request a certificate in-person or through known channels!
2. TBD
