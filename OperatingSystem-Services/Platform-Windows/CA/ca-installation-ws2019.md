On every install of Windows Server, service named "Server Manager" will be mainly used to install and modify features.

Connect to your machine and find your way to the Server Manager service (should be able to search for the program if it does not automatically show up, 'servermanager' from Win+R).

On the main dashboard page, select the option that reads "Add roles and features"

Skipping the "Before you Begin" page, select "Role-based feature or installation" on the page that follows.

Click next, and from the local server list, choose the server to install the feature on, and click next. This will most likely be your local machine.

The "Server Roles" page that comes up is the list of roles you'd wish to install. The only necessary installation for setting up the CA is "Active Directory Certificate Services." Select this, and on the popup page, select "Add features" to install the dependencies as well.

Nothing else is required on the "Features" page, and the initial "AD CS" page can be skipped as well.

On the following page, entitled "Role Services," there are a few useful services that may make the CA installation more accessible, however, the only necessary installation from this page is simply "Certification Authority." Make sure to keep this selected, select any other role services that may be used, and click Next.

The final page is for confirmation. There is a single option that can be selected, enabling automatic restarts on the server if restarts are necessary. Select your preference, and click install.

Once the installation completes, you can close out of the installation page entirely, though setup is still necessary.
