##
# Usage: Backup all user authorized keys (Except Whitelist)
#
# The goal of this script is to create a new group and user account.  The account will have an authorized key
# file setup and password.
#
# Initially written by a Tired Matthew Harper
# Based on: Files in the OLD directory
#
# NOTE: The Password must be hashed. We can generate a password with the `mkpasswd` command from the `whois` package
