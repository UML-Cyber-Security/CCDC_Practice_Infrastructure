- Identity provider solution
	- Can be used as its own identity provider
	- Can be used with AD to be able to sync together
		- Put credentials into Keycloak
		- Authenticate to other systems using Keycloak credentials
		- Create own identity provider
	- Task:
		- Create own Keycloak identity provider
		- Keycloak serves as default identity management solution, first of all
		- Second of all, serve as an OpenID/OAuth provider
			- Go on website, says that this website wants to authenticate using Google Account
				- This would be OpenID
			- Use Keycloak credentials to authenticate with external (not Keycloak) identification
		- Set up Keycloak
		- Use as default identity management solution
	- Future task:
		- SSH into systems using OAuth2
		- SSH and web applications will all eventually go through OAuth2
	- If not authenticated with OAuth2, will take you to website where you can register
	- If authenticated, automatically SSH into system
	- Essentially skipping password based and public key authentication
	- Use common credentials for the infrastructure
