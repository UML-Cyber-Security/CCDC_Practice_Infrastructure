- Deploy two Windows servers
		- One will run as certificate authority
			- Chisom Explanation
				- If machine wants to prove who they are, communicate with CA
				- CA will give machine/website a Cert
				- Signed cert essentially says machine/website is who they say they are
				- There are trusted certificate authorities (DigiCert) provide certs to websites that register with them
					- When browser types in youtube.com, the browser, with the CA linked to browser and the website having a signed Cert, knows it is the right website
				- "Something like that, and I think that's the best I can do"
				- Machine sends request and signs the certificate request with the machine's private key
				- CA verifies the private key of the machine using the machine's public key
				- Browser will not trust an untrusted CA by default unless browser config is modified
					- Force browser to trust this self signed certificate
				- If CA private key is stolen, false certificates can most likely be generated
				- Root CA = Big Man in the Sky
			- Non Chisom Explanation
				- Do not let CA keys get stolen
				- For now, set up CA
				- Future:
					- Use CA for setting up secure connections for whole network
		- For now, nothing on other Windows machine
