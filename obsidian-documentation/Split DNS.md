- Implementation up to us
		- If request comes in from outside:
			- zodu.com (example)
			- only be served externally
			- should have its own DNS entries
				- app1.zodu.com
			- May have certain cases where private system resolves IP addresses
				- Soln.
					- Internal DNS server
					- dev.zodu.com
				- If request from outside goes to dev.zodu.com, should be rejected
				- If internal request goes to outside domain, should also be rejected
		- Should be resolved based on zone of device
	- No DNS server outside of subnet, should all be within infrastructure
	- Server should be inside with public requests able to go in
