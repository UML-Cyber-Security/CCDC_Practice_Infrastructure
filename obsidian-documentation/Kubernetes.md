- Create Kubernetes cluster within infrastructure
		- K8S cluster
		- Config:
			- 1 Master
			- 3 Workers
			- Don't want simple cluster
			- master and workers to be running on longhorn
	- Longhorn:
		- Distributed storage
		- Specifically built for Kubernetes
		- Systems will contribute their own storage to create distributed Longhorn storage
		- Makes services highly available
		- Have some database:
			- If database is on Worker 1, and worker 1 falls
				- Without distributed storage, database will look for its own files once migrate
		- Longhorn shards the data to create multiple replicas of files, making data available on all systems of cluster
		- Even if database crashes and moves to another worker, it will still have access to its own files
		- Storage method depends on solution itself
			- Entire file could stay one one disc and be replicated to others
			- Not sure how longhorn handles
		- Persistent volume clean
		- Protects against system falling and data loss occurring
	- Why Longhorn?
		- Other option is bad or something I don't really know
		- Nightmares or something I'm too dumb to follow this
	- After setup:
		- Find ways to deploy services onto the cluster
		- Work with databases involved
		- Secure databases
		- Migration focus
